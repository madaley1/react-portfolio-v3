V3 of my portfolio. I'm still deciding what I want from it, but I want a MERN like stack, with a few technologies in particular:
- Next.js with React
- MySQL DB
- Prisma ORM
- Docker compose file for quick spinning up of test containers
- SQL dump file & regular backing up in case I delete the db (needed from experience)
